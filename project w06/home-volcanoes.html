      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        Ecuador is home to some of the most magnificent and active volcanoes in the world.
        From snow-capped peaks to simmering craters, each volcano holds a story of ancient power and natural wonder.
        Our mission is to guide you through these geological marvels — to understand their origins, appreciate their beauty,
        and respect the powerful forces that shape our planet. Join us as we explore the landscapes that define Ecuador’s unique identity.
